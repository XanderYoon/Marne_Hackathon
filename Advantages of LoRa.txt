Advantages of LoRa:
    -Higher security (out of usual frequency range)
         -Chirp spread spectrum
    -(Long Range Radio) is the range of effectiveness
    -Generally faster/lower latency
    -Cheaper
    -Lower power usage = longer life span in the field (without needing charging)

Fatal Flaw:
    -Lacks ability to be scaled
        -cannot easily control multiple ESP8266s off of one interface
