Advantages of WiFi:
    -HTML offers improved graphical/user interface

Fatal Flaw:
    -The (short) range of Wifi is the biggest detractor
    -Weak connection and latency
    -I failed to create a two board setup
        -Board A: both an access point (AP) and a server (this is not possible on ESP8266)
        -Board B: a client
    -Unsure how scalable: being able to individually control each ESP8266 (the IP addresses would identical amongst all clients)
