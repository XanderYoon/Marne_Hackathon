Project Statement: Development of a Low-Cost, Lightweight, and Easily Constructible Decoy Infantry Fighting Vehicle with Dynamic Sensor Deception Capability

Problem Statement:
The 3rd Infantry Division faces the challenge of advising partner forces in the creation of a decoy Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) to enhance tactical deception capabilities. This decoy must be designed for ease of construction using locally-sourced materials, requiring minimal building experience. It should possess the capability to dynamically replicate a pattern of life that deceives enemy sensors across various spectrums, including visual, thermal, and electromagnetic. Drawing inspiration from historical examples like General Patton's use of fake tanks during World War II (Patton's Ghost Army), our objective is to enable modern military forces to deploy cost-effective and lightweight decoy IFVs with a lifespan of approximately 72 hours.

Approach:
Our project will focus on meeting the following key requirements:

Cost-Effectiveness: We aim to develop a decoy IFV that can be constructed using affordable, readily available materials, minimizing the financial burden on partner forces.

Lightweight Design: The decoy IFV should be lightweight for ease of transportation and deployment, enabling rapid repositioning as needed.

Extended Lifespan: To maintain deception over an extended period, the decoy IFV must operate effectively for approximately 72 hours, emulating the presence of a real IFV throughout this duration.

Dynamic Sensor Deception: The decoy IFV should possess the capability to mimic the radio communications of a genuine armored unit. This includes transmitting signals to produce false signatures across the electromagnetic spectrum while avoiding interference with friendly communications.

Frequency Manipulation: To enhance deception, the decoy IFV will incorporate a system with four relays, allowing for dynamic frequency hopping (freqHop). These relays will be controlled randomly, simulating the varying radio frequencies used by real armored units.

By combining these elements, we aim to provide partner forces with a versatile and cost-effective tool for tactical deception. This project will contribute to enhancing the operational capabilities of the 3rd Infantry Division and its partner forces, enabling them to employ advanced deception tactics inspired by historical successes while leveraging modern technology.
